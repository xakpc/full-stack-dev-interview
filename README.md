# Introduction
Recently I was preparing for a full-stack lead developer interview. As a tech ex-entrepreneur who spent 6y building and delivering enterprise products, I needed to refresh some core aspects. Here is the small list of videos, articles, and courses which I found quite useful for preparing for a full-stack interview (with focus on back-end tbh)

# Data Structures and Algorithms
IMO Mosh is the best here. I checked the introduction, bought the course immediately.
